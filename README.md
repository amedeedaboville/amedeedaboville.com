This repository contains my personal website.

This theme has a long history. I took it from my friend Jaan Altosaar's [jaan.io](https://jaan.io),
and it initially started out as [Cole Townsend](http://coletownsend.com)'s [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) theme.
Jaan made a lot of good improvements listed [here](https://github.com/altosaar/jaan.io)

I run the site through a $5 DigitalOcean dropplet with Dokku.
I'll link to a tutorial on setting up a dropplet and adding a remote; now I can push to publish.
