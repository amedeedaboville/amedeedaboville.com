This repository contains my personal website.

This theme has a long history. I took it from my friend Jaan Altosaar's [jaan.io](https://jaan.io),
and it initially started out as [Cole Townsend](http://coletownsend.com)'s [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) theme.
Jaan made a lot of good improvements listed [here](https://github.com/altosaar/jaan.io)

I run the site through a $5 DigitalOcean dropplet with Dokku. It rebuilds the site with every git push.
But it also re-builds the entire docker container, so instead I might modify https://github.com/codewerft/docker.jekyllinstance to use proper git hooks. 

I'll link to a tutorial on setting up a dropplet to do this soon.
