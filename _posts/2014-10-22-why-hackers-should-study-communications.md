When we build new tech, we focus extensively on the topology and hierarchies we use, and the effects of certain requirements on
these. For example, building a distributed, fault tolerant system requires a certain structure of computers and makes certain demands on 
our systems. We think about these technical requirements extensively, but why do we stop there?

Our downtime-proof systems themselves exist in peoples' lives, and a fuzzy network of social relations. Our user requirements come out of these relations.
How we fulfill these requirements shape our users' lives. Our products mean things to them. Either it's "that shitty application everyone
has to use to submit expense reports" or "that great app that lets me get a cab whenever I want."

We rarely think about this. Sometimes CEO's do, and it's "the big picture". Marketing does, in a way. But never "hackers".
I propose that hackers should do this, because otherwise their productions can be used to do bad things, against their will.

Communication studies is the broad field of looking at how our technologies shape our lives. Its most famous soundbite is Marshall
McLuhan's "The medium is the message". The idea is that instead of looking at technologies as neutral carriers of information where
"what you do with it is what matters", technology shapes lives. Techs afford some things, value some things above others, make some activities
harder, others easier, others irrelevant, etc.

##What message is your new medium sending?

This where communications studies come in. There are other fields related to making sense of the world, but this one is a great start for 
hackers. The idea is to look at how techs "are shaped by existing and create new social relations".


No matter what you think about politics, we can actually help fix broken laws and structures like the prison system, the war on drugs, the way healthcare works in the US.
These are _technical questions_. Not in the sense that a new app is going to fix them, but through figuring out the boundaries
and forces acting on these social systems, we can guide our technical solutions. By using our technical tools, knowledge of systems and 
modelling, we can implement new solutions.

But if we make more software that spies on and tracks users, if we start companies around Command & Control systems, or create marketplaces
that re-inforce specific differences, we're hurting the world. When we use certain algorithms, we make assumptions about the world, which may
act as self-fulfilling prophecies.. When we
should to hold data forever by default, because it's easier, we're making mean political statements. 

We've also structured SV for ageism and single pointedness. Our tech is sending messages crafted by 22 year old pseudohipsters:
"When we were sitting down with Obama. I turned to these guys.
Yes we're making a lot of money and changing the world. But mostly, we're changing the world.
Through constructing elegant hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensability." - HBO's Silicon Valley

## Fundamentally the hackers are the ones who make the valuable thing -pg

Paul Graham once defined hackers as having three desires: money, power, and to make something.
Nobly, getting rich is only for "freedom to hack things where they don't have to worrry about money".
If you are hacker who is interested in power, it behooves you to study how current media and culture affects the structuring of power in our society.
How can you try to 'change the way people connect' and not study other medias and how they affected how people connect?
Otherwise you end up making the world a better place through minimal message-oriented transport layers.
