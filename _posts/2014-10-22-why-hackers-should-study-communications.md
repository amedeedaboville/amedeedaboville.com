When we build new tech, we focus extensively on the topology and hierarchies we use, and the effects of certain requirements on
these. For example, building a distributed, fault tolerant system requires a certain structure of computers and makes certain demands on 
our systems. We think about these technical requirements extensively, but why do we stop there?

Our downtime-proof systems themselves exist in the lives of people. Our requirements comes out of a massive, fuzzy network of social relations
that these people live in, and how will fulfill the requirements shapes their lives and the social network.
For these reasons our products mean things to people. We rarely think about this, and the politics of our tools.
There are people in other departments of companies to do this for us. But never "hackers".
I propose that hackers should do this, because otherwise their work can be used to do bad things.
You may accept that working for Uber is making the world a better place because now anyone can get a cab anytime, but not see the
inequality it pushes forward. Or assume positive side effects of the tech you are working on.

##Where to start
There are many fields and many writers that study how technology affects society and its systems of culture.

A great one to start is Communication Studies, which is the broad field of looking at how our interactions with and through technologies shape our lives.
Its most famous soundbite is Marshall McLuhan's "The medium is the message". The idea is that instead of looking at technologies as neutral carriers of information
or just tea kettles where "what you do with it is what matters", technology shapes lives in political ways. Tools can make some things dramatically easier,
others harder, others irrelevant, and therebey end up valuing some things/people/experiences above others...
For example, before the early PC's, there existed the positions of graph-maker. Before that, humans were put in rooms to be huge calculators. 
The fact that these positions are not commonly hired for anymore has had a huge effect on people working in those fields. 

Crudely, we as hackers need to continously be asking, "What message is our new medium sending?"

Hackers can help fix broken laws and structures like the prison system, the war on drugs, and the way healthcare works in the US.
These are _technical questions_. Not in the sense that a new app is going to fix them, but through figuring out the boundaries
and forces acting on these social systems, we can guide our technical solutions. By using our technical tools, knowledge of systems and 
modelling, we can implement new solutions.

But if we make more software that spies on and tracks users, if we start companies around Command & Control systems, or create marketplaces
that re-inforce specific differences, we're hurting the world. When we use certain algorithms, we make assumptions about the world, which may
act as self-fulfilling prophecies.. When we
should to hold data forever by default, because it's easier, we're making mean political statements. 

We've also structured SV for ageism and single pointedness. Our tech is sending messages crafted by 22 year old pseudohipsters:
"When we were sitting down with Obama. I turned to these guys.
Yes we're making a lot of money and changing the world. But mostly, we're changing the world.
Through constructing elegant hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensability." - HBO's Silicon Valley

Paul Graham once defined hackers as having three desires: money, power, and to make something. First, lolololol.
(Nobly, getting rich is only for "freedom to hack things where they don't have to worrry about money")
Second, if you are hacker who is interested in power, it behooves you to study how current media and culture affects the structuring of power in our society.
How can you try to 'change the way people connect' and not study other medias and how they affected how people connect?
Otherwise you end up making the world a better place through minimal message-oriented transport layers.

###Avoid Techno-determinism
On the other hand, it is easy in getting caught up with the consequences of technology and forget there are humans using them. McLuhan himself did this,
and he claimed the printing press essentially caused the American Revolution. "Twitter" did not cause the Arab spring.
