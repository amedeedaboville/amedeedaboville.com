> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - Arthur C. Clarke

This is everyone in Silicon Valley's favorite quote, and it has to die.
It's wrong, both in the sense that it's factually incorrect, and that it's bad for us.

###Incorrect

Here is the problem: The iPad is not Indistinguishable From Magic (IFM) because it's soooo advanced. It's not like in a few years, given
advanced developments in scanning tunnelling microscopes and new theories of quantum gravity, we'll figure out how
it works. The iPad is a shitty ARM CPU with a few gigs of RAM connected to a capactive touchscreen
running a Debian OS. It's not magical, it's just packaged that way (fused batteries and all).
We're making a big mistake by marketing these piles of hacks as 'beautiful machines' that 'just work'.

###Unhealthy

This goes deeper than marketing, it's also an engineering problem. Although, at first, the idea that 'it just works' and you don't have to think about anything
else sounds like good engineering, not bad design. And all of engineering is built on top of this idea, through black box abstraction: You assume the thing does what it's supposed to do, so you can build on top.
It's hard to see how black box abstraction could be bad. 

However, every grizzled engineer knows that abstractions leak. You always spend most of your time in the abstraction layer below yours.
By black boxing the computer, you are giving the user no control at all, because they don't have access to the abstraction layer below theirs.
"But the user doesn't care!" By assumming that, you aren't even _letting_ them care, and then you fuse the battery to the motherboard.

IFM leads to a way of thinking about computers as packaged, commoditized black boxes, that only a select few know how to operate.
That's not a new criticism, that kids using iPads won't tinker the same way they would with a linux laptop.
But it's part of a bigger argument, the root of this problem which is the idea that technology should be Magic.

###The wizards

I believe the main source of IFM ideology is us nerds. We like it and reinforce it because if technology is magic, that makes
us wizards. We enjoy the power of these techs. And as much as we enjoy making fun of the way hackers on TV are portrayed as kids
with glasses that hack into the NSA, we get a little bit of social validation from knowing this is how people see us.
But seeing ourselves this way causes all these problems.
When senators don't know how computers work and sentence kids who ssh into open machines for 20 years in prison, that's on us.

We need to stop acting like these are magical things and give up the feeling that we run the world, to make computers normal.

###How to fix this
That might be easy to misquote, and react with 'take out the magic! No way!' But essentially, computers are toys. And there are
good toys and there are bad toys. We need to make sure that these things are easy enough to play with.

We are the people with the tools and the power to change things. We've taken a stand against RTFM culture, where it takes half an hour to read a man page.
But now we're assuming "The user doesn't care about parameters, let's just set a good default and not let them change anything".
There is a middle ground. Interfaces are meeting point for humans and computers. They are part human and part computer.
There needs to be a bit of both.

We need to put a bigger focus on being able to open up the things we build. Physically, and in software.
