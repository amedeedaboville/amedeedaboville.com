Use Social Media extensively. Change the way you live to fit in with it: make sure your information
can be consumed more easily by your friends.

This is tough sometimes, as social lives are often too complex to
easy share with others. But here are some ways to project yourself into cyberspace: Check in. Take pictures of what you are doing. Take pictures of
your friends (especially if they aren't on the network) and put them online. Tag them in the pictures, and add their location.
Share everything. Tell us about every aspect of your life. The heart-wrenching sadness of last night's
Season Finale and the excitement at that new album coming out.  

Tell everyone what you've been watching, listening, and reading on  Netflix, Spotify, and Medium (although We already know).
Tell us about your relationships. Tell us about your health.
You can post about other things than these, but make sure it's still on facebook or tumblr, and to tweet about it later.

Make sure you are connected. Use your real name everywhere.
People who don't want to use their real names or constantly Share have done something wrong, and you don't have anything to hide.
Make sure to friend people on facebook. Complain that you can't leave because your friends are on there.

Have spirited discussions about Social Media with your friends. Tell them it's ruining our social fabric.
Nod when they say it makes people inauthenic.

Don't change any of your online behavior.

Above all, care about convenience. Only use services and software that are easy to use, even if they sell
out your data, and your values.
Don't learn about computers. Those things are icky, full of math, and ugly. Complain that technology
sucks, and never works for you.
Don't learn about encryption. Send sensitive information over facebook chat or apple services.  Or email. If you get hacked, blame the big companies.

Stay afraid of Hackers.

Blame the big companies that they are devaluing our lives and making us work for them free by submitting our information to their websites for free.
Argue they are shifting our values of society towards one that is more profitable for them. Then, don't learn about technology. Don't build websites
that challenge anything. Don't use technology in unapproved ways, like downloading unapproved apps, booting unapproved operating systems, modifying 
source codes, or typing in your own URLs.

Don't open your computers. They are dangerous and sensitive, not to mention complicated. Pay some Geniuses to figure it out.

That should be good for now. As always, things change and we'll revise these instructions later. We'll let you know if anything changes.
