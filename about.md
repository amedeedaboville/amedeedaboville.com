I dig cognitive stuff.

The best way to reach me is by email at [amedee.daboville@gmail.com](mailto:amedee.daboville@gmail.com). Feel free to connect via:

I'm a recent McGill Grad with a degree in Software Engineering.
My technical interests are: data science/inference, automating things through knowledge engineering, formal verification, theory of computing.

I enjoy the feeling when you swap an inner loop with an outer loop and get a modest speed increase,
when you look at a mess and you say "I know an abstraction to clean this up" and it works,
