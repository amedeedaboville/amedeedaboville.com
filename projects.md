###Fealines
Fealines is a cross-platform app for collecting EEG data for people who own the Interaxon Muse.

###PocketSangha
I made an app for meditators to talk to each other for Mind and Life 2014.

###Voronoify
I had this idea for an image filter based on the voronoi transform. It picks random points on an image.
Then, for each pixel in my new image, I color it the same color as the nearest point.

###Clover Hashpan
I submitted an entry to Clover's hashpan contest.

###Spire 2014
I worked at Spire right before their launch in 2014. I helped benchmark some data analysis algorithms.

###Transcriptic 2013
I was an intern at Transcriptic a year after it started. I helped program thermocycler drivers in Scala.

###Rowgger
My first hardware/software project; I had plans to put an accelerometer on a rowing boat to measure my rowing prowess.
